Watch & Touch is aimed to be a complete, free & open source, multi-platform, interactive whiteboard system which supports multi-touch gestures, complemented by an in-classroom collaborative working client to increase student participation in classroom activities.

Developed as a graduation project at METU CENG (www.ceng.metu.edu.tr) by a team of four students, it supports:
 - turning surfaces into interactive whiteboards using a WiiMote
 - multi-touch gesture support
 - annotation & recall for web pages, videos and PDF documents
 - collaborative drawing for teacher-student interaction
